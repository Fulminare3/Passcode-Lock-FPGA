This project contains files that read in numerical values from a 16 character button pad. The code was
intended to interface with the Nexys4 DDR board by Xilinx. I designed the code to work like 2 nested statemachines

The second picture shows the flag varible state machine logic, and the first pictures shows the two state machines for
storing and checking the users input.
